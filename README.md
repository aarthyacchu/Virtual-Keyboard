# Virtual Keyboard 

This project combines a virtual on-screen keyboard with physical keyboard support, allowing users to input text using either option. It features a visually appealing and interactive keyboard layout with a glassy, pastel aesthetic and functionality for various keyboard actions, including typing, backspace, and search.


## Features

- Virtual Keyboard: Users can type using on-screen buttons, designed with a modern, glassy look.
- Physical Keyboard Support: Input is captured from the physical keyboard as well, enhancing accessibility.
- Real-Time Display: Text typed through either the virtual or physical keyboard appears in the designated display area.
